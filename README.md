## GitHub style for Pygments

GitHub style theme for Pygments, a popular Python syntax highlighter. Identical to the original; just the way it is on GitHub.com.

Comes as two versions:

- **Original (github.css)**: For directly incorporating into any project that's using Pygments.

- **Jekyll Version (jekyll-github.css)**: For use with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby.
